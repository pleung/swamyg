  <div class="post">
	<p>
		My current and long term areas of interest include Human Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous and Social computing, Tangible Interfaces especially in areas such as Web (or Web 4.0 as I've dubbed it <span class="blue">:)</span> ) and music, music technology, Digital Signal Processing, Intelligent Systems.
		I also have a fascination for the field of cognitive science but never got to study more than a few books on it.
		So here are a sample of my dreams for the future, some of which someday I hope to realize in my graduate studies.<br/><br/>
		<b>The Ice Breaker</b><br/>
		  Ok, so your single in a place full of eligible women (or men) and you're hoping you would find someone interesting. But how do you even know where to begin with. Well the ice breaker is just for you. It is a tiny device that you wear (as a pendant or ring) 
		which contains your tastes in say, music, movies and other criteria that you look for in a prospective date. The are other people in the room who are wearing this same device. When a person wearing the ice breaker
		passes by you, the device immediately checks for the compatibility quotient. If this is higher than a threshold value then both of these devices glow in the same color allowing you to easily "break the ice" with them.<br/><br/>
		<b>Beat to the Dance</b><br/>
		  Beat to the dance is a special shoe which a person wears that produces music according to pressure and spacial location of the area that is pressed against the floor. Different areas of the sole, such as the tip, the heel, produce different tones whose loudness can be controlled by the pressure of the step.
		Much like how tap dancing works, you can create a new beat by dancing with the special shoes on. It might take skill and dedication to work a nice routine out, but that is the fun part right? Could be done using piezoelectric sensors which produce a pulse
		according to the pressure applied to it. The music synthesis is taken care of by a special software program to which these pulses are sent.<br/><br/>
		<b>The Will to Gym</b><br/>
		  This is especially be useful for a person such as me who often loses his "will to gym" no matter how much he/she wants to lose weight and stay in shape. I often feel out of place in a gym simply because working out isn't' my thing. I've often wondered why the gym cannot be a fun place.
		The Will to Gym is my idea for the gym of the future. Lets say your treadmill is wired as the input to a marathon race game and depending on your effort you either or win or lose the game, wouldn't that be a motivating factor for you to hit the treadmill once a day? And lets say we have
		this program which needs at least 20 push-ups for you to get to the top of the castle and rescue the imprisoned princess, now isn't that more interesting than playing Super Mario with joysticks? And the great part about this tangible gymming is that you also stay fit and improve your health as a side effect. We could also 
		induce collaboration in the scenario much like how computer games allow two players.<br/><br/>
		<b>The Mood Machine.</b><br/>
		  Have you ever wondered how the earth feels today? By earth I mean its people, their emotion or mood to be specific. Lets suppose we have a website where people can go and register their mood. They could choose anything from ecstatic, happy to sad, morose, afraid and so on.
		All these moods have a certain value assigned to them based on a scale. The website then periodically scans through the inputs and processes them using a special algorithmic (which could be as simple as an average of the input) and give out this output to any service or device that is requesting it.
		Now we can configure an orb or any ambient device to periodically receive this data and make it glow accordingly. So a bright green means the earth is feeling happy on an average or a red means it is outraged. We can also tune the orb so that the the data it receives corresponds to only people
		living from a certain city or area thereby localizing its function.<br/><br/>
		<b>Huggy</b><br/>
		  One of the areas that is lacking in online human interactions is human emotion. I feel that a human hug is one of the strongest yet easiest (involves less muscle functions) way to show how you feel about another person. It could be a person you love or someone you care or your best friend, everybody understands a hug. I have 
		envisioned a future where these hugs are transmittable over networks. There'd be these two human like arms attached to a torso which is connected to another such device through a computer over a network. When person A hugs the first device, this hug is recorded and transmitted by the computer to the second device which the other person
		is hugging. The pressure and sensitivity of person A's hug is replicated with careful precision to show how he/she feels about person B.<br/><br/>
		<b>Online Music Collaboration.</b><br/>
		  This is an old idea of mine since college. Being a musician myself I've wanted to jam with a lot of different people but finding people in your neighborhood and setting up the equipments can be a hassle. 
		I have always thought making online collaboration possible had great potential for emergence of new creative music. We can make borders disappear and cost will never be a factor in such scenarios. I have experimented
		with existing open-source softwares like NinJAM which have produced good results. I want to improve them to good precision or build similar programs which could help foster a more collaborative environment in music.
		By interfacing it with devices such as the <a href="http://rectable.iua.upf.edu" class="normal">rectable</a> we can make it a tangible collaborative music software.<br/><br/>
		<b>Sweetspot</b><br/>
		  Sweetspot is an idea motivated by an actual need. I have the habbit of playing my favorite music on external speakers and moving about in the room. This upsets the whole listening experience since I'm always in and out of the sweetspot (spot where the sound from the two speakers converge).
		I've always wanted to build a trackable device which rotates the speakers (which is kept on top it) to align with the moving user so that he never misses the sweetspot. Though I came close to an actual plan of building this
		I just had to give up due to lack of time and work pressure.<br/><br/>
		<b>One Drumkit Per Child (ODPC)</b><br/>
		  If I ever wanted to give something to the community this would be it. I want to extend my <a href="<?echo $base_url;?>/projects/edrum" class="normal">edrum</a> project into a full working model as a replacement for the expensive v-drums. By using old keyboard circuits and writing my own code to synthesize the midi triggers I can bring 
		down the production costs of such drumkits to less than $100.
