	  	Aloha visitors! I'm Swamy, from good old Chennai, India, currently working on my masters at San Jose State University. Before that I worked for this great start-up called <a href="http://slideshare.net" class="normal">Slideshare</a> in New Delhi, India. I love to create things, be it a cool program, a web site
	or an electronic gizmo or just something to do with carpentary for that matter. I've decided to chronicle my (mis)adventures here so that one day I could look back 
	and say Damn! I've lived my life to the fullest. Things that get me going are technology, music, traveling, ruby on Rails, php, design, philosophy, art and a bunch of 
	other passions. Drumming, sketching and "learning" to play the guitar (7 years now) are some of my hobbies. Feel free to send me feedback about what you think about my projects, my rants and me in general.
